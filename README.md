# scTCHM

## Description
scTCHM (single-cell Time- and Condition-dependent Hazard Model) is a novel deep generative framework that integrates single-cell latent representations from a VAE with bulk-level cell-type proportions and hazard coefficients.
This enables the computation of patient-level risk scores and the identification of cell populations whose prognostic impact dynamically changes across time and clinical conditions.
